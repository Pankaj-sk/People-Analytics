Female attrition model : 

The objective is to provide inputs that can help remediate an attrition crisis among female employees, thereby helping meet diversity targets. 

Methods used - 

logisitic regression - to help identify employees at the highest risk of attrition 

Random forest - Help identify strongest predictors of attrition and high priority items for discussion in one-on-one interations 

The data set is from kaggle - and has been used to shadow my approach
